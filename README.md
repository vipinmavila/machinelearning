My machine learning hobies and exercises

Project #1 The challenge is to predict churn for telecom subscribers based on a French Telecom Operators subscriber database. Dataset contains 50,000 subscriber records and for each subscriber there are 15,000 variables(features).

Notes: Files are only for review of the project. The data set is not made public for any execution.

Project #2 This is pre-processed and labeled data used in Machine Learning-based Anomaly Detection in Software Systems: An Industrial Evaluation. The dataset contains labeled feature vectors for each measurement (one minute apart).Goal is to create model for predicting "isAnomaly" attribute based on other features.

Notes: Files are only for review of the project. The data set is not made public for any execution.

Project #3 Log file contains simulated log data from a cutting-edge Bell Labs 6G mobile base station (hNb) prototype running AI-based Kalevala software. The ultimate goal is to create early warning system for [Systemstatus]: Dysfunctional.Goal in this exercise is to find dependencies between subsystems and the main system.

Project #4 Image processign using convolutional neural networks, data from mnist database.
